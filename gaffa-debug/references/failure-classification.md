# gaffa failure classification

Map recording fields to a likely cause and the smallest fix. Pull the recording with `GET /v1/browser/requests/{id}` and read these fields. All fields live under the top-level `data` object in the response. The field set includes `data.id`, `data.url`, `data.actual_url`, `data.state`, `data.credit_usage`, `data.http_status_code`, `data.from_cache`, `data.started_at`, `data.completed_at`, `data.running_time`, `data.page_load_time`, and `data.actions` (each action carries its result as a URL in `output`). When relevant the response also carries `data.error`, `data.error_reason`, and `data.proxy_location`. With `record_request: true` it also includes `data.video`. A finished request has `data.state` equal to `completed`.

| Signal in recording | Likely cause | Smallest fix |
|---|---|---|
| `data.http_status_code` 4xx plus `data.error_reason` | gaffa API misuse (malformed body, bad field) | One-line patch to the offending field |
| Bare 403 `Forbidden`, no recording, no `data.error_reason`, non-curl client | edge blocked the request User-Agent | Set an explicit `User-Agent` header. Confirm the same request works from curl |
| `data.state` `completed` but an action `output` is empty | target-site DOM change vs wrong selector | Diff actions against a fresh capture, then correct the selector or accept the DOM moved |
| `parse_json` action has `error: action_failed`, no `output` | invalid `data_schema`, or `parse_json` run over the full DOM of a large page | Fix the schema to the structured form first. If the schema is valid, narrow the input with a `selector` or `input_token_cap` |
| `data.error_reason` matches bot detection or captcha | target-site bot protection | Set `proxy_location` to a residential location (us, ie, sg, fr). If blocked, try another, unless the goal is geo-specific. Not a script change |
| `data.running_time` much greater than `data.page_load_time` | flaky timing | Add a `wait` action or raise `time_limit` |
| `data.from_cache: true` when fresh data expected | cross-user cache hit | Set `max_cache_age: 0` or change a parameter to bust the cache key |
| `GET` returns 404 | recording expired past retention | Re-run with `record_request: true`. Retention is 7 days / 30 days / 3 months by plan |

## Notes

- `max_cache_age` and `proxy_location` are root-level body fields, not under `settings`.
- Always scrub credential-named fields out of the recording before showing it.
- Prefer the smallest fix. A rewrite is rarely the right first move.
