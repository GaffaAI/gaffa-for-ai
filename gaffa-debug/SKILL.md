# gaffa debug

Given a failing gaffa script or a `brq_*` request id, pull the recording, classify the failure, and suggest a targeted patch. Prefers a minimal patch over a speculative rewrite, and recognizes when the target site (not the script) is the problem.

A request id paired with a new extraction goal is ambiguous. Ask the developer whether to triage the existing request or start a fresh discovery. The only cap that applies is the credits-per-invocation cap on the optional re-run.

## Cost guardrail cap

- `CREDITS_PER_INVOCATION` default `50`. The optional re-run counts against this cap.

## Critical gaffa facts (grounding)

1. Auth header is `X-API-Key: <key>`. Read from `GAFFA_API_KEY` env var. Never hard-code.
2. `POST /v1/browser/requests` is async by default. Returns an id. Poll `GET /v1/browser/requests/{id}`. Opt into sync with `"async": false`.
3. Max runtime is plan-tiered (1 / 2 / 5 min) for both sync and async. Always set `settings.time_limit` explicitly.
4. `parse_json` is token-priced, so its cost scales with the content parsed rather than being a flat per-call charge. Stored `/v1/schemas` extractions run the same `parse_json` action and are priced the same way. Check the live docs for the current model and token rates. Other actions are deterministically priced.
5. Request recordings (`settings.record_request: true`) are strongly recommended for `/gaffa-debug`. Without one, the skill can only suggest re-running the failing request with recording enabled. Plan-tiered retention applies (7 days / 30 days / 3 months).

The API base URL is `https://api.gaffa.dev`. Every `/v1/...` endpoint is called on that host. The documentation and the docs MCP live on `https://gaffa.dev`. API responses are wrapped in a top-level `data` object, so read fields as `data.id`, `data.state`, `data.credit_usage`, and `data.actions`. A finished request has `data.state` equal to `completed`. Each action result is a URL in `data.actions[].output`. The gaffa edge rejects some default HTTP-client User-Agents (for example Python `urllib`) with a 403, so emitted code should set an explicit `User-Agent` header. curl works with its default User-Agent. In the request body, `actions`, `time_limit`, and `record_request` go under `settings`, while `url`, `async`, `max_cache_age`, and `proxy_location` are root-level. `time_limit` is in milliseconds. The `parse_json` action uses a structured `data_schema` of the form `{name, description, fields: [{type, name, description}]}`, never a flat object and never a `schema` or `prompt` field. An optional `instruction` parameter sits beside `data_schema` (not inside it) for extra parsing guidance. `/v1/schemas` is an endpoint for reusable stored schemas, not an action type. LLM-backed extraction runs through the `parse_json` action, with an inline `data_schema` or a stored `data_schema_id`, and there is no separate schema action type. On a large content-rich page, `parse_json` over the full DOM can fail with `action_failed` (verified on Wikipedia), so narrow the input with a `selector` for the region that holds the data, or set `input_token_cap`.

## Credential hygiene

1. Read `GAFFA_API_KEY` from env only. Never hard-code in emitted code. Reference it as `${GAFFA_API_KEY}`.
2. Never echo, log, narrate, or persist the value of `GAFFA_API_KEY`. Never put it in a URL or query string.
3. Before showing a gaffa recording, error trace, or request body to the user, to an LLM judge, or to disk, strip the values of any fields whose names match (case-insensitive, including vendor-prefixed variants like `gaffa_api_key`): `Authorization`, `X-API-Key`, `api_key` (and `apiKey`, `api-key`), `cookie`, `set-cookie`. Replace the value with `<REDACTED>`.
4. If the runtime value of `GAFFA_API_KEY` appears as a substring anywhere in a payload you are about to show or persist, replace it with `<REDACTED>`. Only enable this substring scrub when the env value is at least 16 characters long and contains both a digit and a letter. Otherwise skip and warn the developer on first invocation that the entropy floor was not met (field-name and prose rules still apply).
5. Persisted writes (the `/gaffa-find` reasoning log `./.gaffa-find-<timestamp>.log`, the `/gaffa-bulk` state file `./.gaffa-bulk-<run-id>/state.json`, and any other on-disk artifact) go through redaction first, then to a tempfile, then atomic-rename to the final path. A crash mid-write must not leave a plaintext-secrets file on disk.
6. If unsure whether a string is a secret, redact it.

## Doc-fetching strategy

Resolve documentation queries in two tiers, in order.

1. Preferred: gaffa docs MCP server at `https://gaffa.dev/docs/~gitbook/mcp`. `searchDocumentation` (param `query`) for "how do I do X". `getPage` (param `url`) to fetch one page by URL.
2. Fallback: live HTTP fetch. `?ask=` against the docs for narrow lookups, `https://gaffa.dev/docs/llms.txt` for breadth. Per-call timeout of 5 seconds.

MCP availability probe, once per session, cached, total budget 10 seconds: JSON-RPC `initialize`, then the mandatory `notifications/initialized` notification, then `tools/list` confirming `searchDocumentation` and `getPage` (or at least one). Per-call MCP timeout is 5 seconds. Two consecutive timeouts demote to live HTTP for the rest of the session, announced once.

If both tiers fail before any diagnosis work, refuse with a clear message (suggest registering the MCP if none was configured).

## First action

If a `brq_*` id is provided, call `GET /v1/browser/requests/{id}` first to pull the recording. If a script is provided without an id, read the script and, when the developer agrees, re-run it once with recording enabled to produce a recording to inspect.

Important limitation of the recording: the `GET` response does not echo the submitted request body or the action configuration. Each entry in `data.actions` carries only its `id`, `type`, `timestamp`, an `error` if it failed, and an `output` URL if it produced one. So you can see that an action failed and read the top-level `data.error_reason`, but you cannot read the exact parameters that were sent. When the misuse is in the request body (for example an invalid `parse_json` `data_schema`), name the most likely cause from the failure signal and ask the developer for the request body or the script, or recommend a re-run with `record_request` plus `capture_dom` and `capture_screenshot` to gather more signal. Do not claim to have read a parameter you could not see.

## Behavior

- If `GET /v1/browser/requests/{id}` returns 404, surface the plan-tiered retention reality (Starter 7 days, Startup 30 days, Growth 3 months). The recording has likely expired.
- If `settings.record_request` was not set on the original request, surface that no recording was captured, so a re-run is needed to inspect what happened.
- A recommended re-run sets `record_request: true` and adds `capture_dom` and `capture_screenshot` actions.
- All recording payloads have credential fields scrubbed per the credential-hygiene rules before being shown to the developer, to Claude, or to any LLM judge.
- If the diagnosis is inconclusive (an expired recording, no recording and no re-run, or a target-side failure with no script-side fix), end the output with one line: *Still stuck? Run `/gaffa-support` to get help or file a report.*

### Failure classification from recording fields

All of these fields live under the top-level `data` object in the response.

- `data.http_status_code` 4xx plus `data.error_reason` indicates gaffa API misuse. Emit a minimal patch.
- A bare 403 `Forbidden` with no recording and no `data.error_reason`, especially from a non-curl client such as Python `urllib`, often means the gaffa edge blocked the request User-Agent. Recommend setting an explicit `User-Agent` header before assuming a key or permission problem. Confirm by checking whether the same request succeeds from curl.
- `data.state` is `completed` but an action returned an empty `output` indicates a target-site DOM change versus a wrong selector. Diff the actions against a fresh capture to tell which.
- `data.error` is `action_failed` on a `parse_json` action has two common, verified causes. First, an invalid `data_schema`: it must be the structured form `{name, description, fields: [{type, name, description}]}`, and a flat object such as `{"title": "string"}`, or a `schema` or `prompt` field, makes the action fail. Second, an un-narrowed large page: `parse_json` over the full DOM of a content-rich page (for example a Wikipedia article) fails even with a valid schema, and the fix is a `selector` for the region that holds the data, or an `input_token_cap`. Check the schema shape first, then the input size. Where the data sits in a stable, well-structured place, say a table or a known element, the third option is to stop using `parse_json` for it: `parse_table` or `capture_element` cannot fail this way, cost the same every run, and are the better patch. Classify that as a wrong action rather than a `parse_json` to be tuned.
- `data.error_reason` matching bot detection or captcha indicates target-site bot protection. Suggest setting `proxy_location` to a residential location (us, ie, sg, fr), not script changes. If one location is blocked, try another supported location, unless the goal is geo-specific and switching would return irrelevant results.
- `data.running_time` much greater than `data.page_load_time` indicates flaky timing. Add a `wait` action or raise `time_limit`. Both are duration strings (for example `00:00:01.04`), not numbers.
- `data.from_cache: true` when fresh data was expected indicates a cross-user cache hit. Set `max_cache_age: 0` to disable, or change a parameter to bust the cache key.

### Patch and re-run

- Prefer minimal patches over rewrites.
- Before emitting any patch or re-run command, read `templates/rerun-with-capture.md` and follow its request shape exactly. Do not write a request body from memory. Every emitted body must obey these rules, which are the most common mistakes to avoid:
  - `actions`, `time_limit`, and `record_request` go under `settings`. Never place `actions` at the top level of the body.
  - `time_limit` is in milliseconds. Use a realistic value such as `60000`, never `60`.
  - `parse_json` uses `data_schema` (structured), never a field called `schema` and never `prompt`.
  - Set an explicit `User-Agent` header.
  - Use the `https://api.gaffa.dev` host and read the key from `${GAFFA_API_KEY}`.
- Optional re-run defaults to OFF. It requires explicit developer confirmation. The re-run cost counts against `CREDITS_PER_INVOCATION`. Show the credit estimate before re-running and proceed only on an explicit yes.

See `references/failure-classification.md` for the field-to-cause table and `templates/rerun-with-capture.md` for the recommended re-run shape.
